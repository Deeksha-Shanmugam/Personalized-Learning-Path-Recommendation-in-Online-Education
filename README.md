# Personalized-Learning-Path-Recommendation-in-Online-Education
Developed a privacy-aware federated learning system using Flower and PyTorch that simulates collaboration between multiple educational institutions to train a student performance prediction model on decentralized data. Each institution (client) trains a local neural network on private datasets and shares only model updates with a central server using the FedAvg aggregation strategy. The system maintains full data confidentiality while enabling accurate, global model convergence. This project highlights the use of federated learning for personalized learning path recommendations in online education while ensuring data privacy and scalability.
